This project is a basic smart security system designed for a 3-in-1 pharmacy (drugstore, convenience store, and clinic). It features motion sensors, intrusion alerts, and CCTV integration to enhance safety and monitoring. The goal is to provide a low-cost, reliable solution for small business security needs.
